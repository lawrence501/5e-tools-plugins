For a year and a day, plants of the type specified at the casting of the spell produce 50% more yield than they normally would, potentially increasing the income of a farm if properly harvested. Bodies destroyed by this spell immediately become useless for {@spell speak with dead|LevelUp}, {@spell animate dead|LevelUp}, {@spell resurrection|LevelUp}, and other similar spells that require a body (the bodies of particularly powerful magical creatures may not be affected by this spell at the DM's discretion)."
