You can spend 3 sorcery points before eating a pound of just about anything organic - bark, grass, cactus flesh, bone, whatever's at hand - and so long as you can stomach the taste, it recovers 1 level of fatigue as your body transmutes it into something more edible. A poisonous substance consumed in this way is still poisonous. You can only benefit from this feature once per long rest."

At the DM's discretion, you may learn additional cryptic information from being attuned to such things."
