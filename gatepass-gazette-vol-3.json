The type of damage dealt by an impression is bludgeoning damage, unless the impression depicts a more specific damage type, such as a knight's sword dealing slashing damage or a mummy dealing necrotic damage. Otherwise, an impression's statistics are determined by its size and artistic style as per Table: Animated Painting. If you manifest 4 or more Small or Tiny impressions, instead of controlling each impression individually they function as an impression swarm. Attacks made against an impression swarm deal half damage. When an impression drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.",

When you combine multiple impressions using this spell, you may simultaneously give them all the same command, which can be specific commands or more general orders such as 'attack this creature' or 'guard this area'. Without commands the impressions act accordingly to the scene they were depicted in, know only the world depicted in the piece, and, barring any obvious interactions, act only to defend themselves.",
