Otherwise, an impression's statistics are determined by its size and artistic style as per Table: Animated Painting.

When you combine multiple impressions using this spell, you may simultaneously give them all the same command, which can be specific commands or more general orders such as 'attack this creature' or 'guard this area'. Without commands the impressions act accordingly to the scene they were depicted in, know only the world depicted in the piece, and, barring any obvious interactions, act only to defend themselves.",
