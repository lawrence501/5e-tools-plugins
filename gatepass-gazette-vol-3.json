Each creature in the area aside from a mykand must make a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is {@condition frightened}. While {@condition frightened} in this way, it regards any Dragon's Head Mushrooms it can see with abject terror, and must use its movement each turn to get out of sight of it. A creature can repeat this saving throw if the mykand or the mykand's allies harm it, ending the effect on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours. If the creature succeeds on a saving throw against the Dragon's Head Mushrooms or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Dragon's Head Mushrooms for 24 hours."
