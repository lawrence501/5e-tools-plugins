				"While a creature wields this silver shield, its face is fully concealed by an illusory silver visor that resembles a blank, featureless face. This grants the wearer advantage on Intimidation checks against its own creature tyep, as well as a {@dice 1d6} expertise die to saving throws made to resist being {@condition charmed}, {@condition debilitated|LevelUp}, or {@condition rattled|LevelUp}. This visor does not impair the creature's vision and can't be removed except by removing the shield. Additionally, while wearing the shield the creature's voice becomes metallic and unrecognisable. Creatures have disadvantage on checks made to identify a creature wielding the shield."
